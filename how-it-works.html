      <div class="step-detail">
        <h2>Step 1: Input Your Topic or Title</h2>
        <p>You start by entering a prompt – it could be a headline, a topic, or even a brief question. For example, *“10 Tips for Healthy Eating”* or *“How does renewable energy benefit the economy?”* The more context you provide (like keywords or a short description of what you want), the better the AI can tailor the output.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-detail">
        <h2>Step 2: AI Research & Draft Generation</h2>
        <p>Once you hit **Generate**, SEOscribe goes to work. Our system consults live web data on your topic (via search APIs) to fetch key facts or recent information. Then the AI (a large language model) composes a structured draft. It ensures the content includes relevant subheadings (H2s/H3s) and covers important points. The AI also keeps SEO in mind – integrating any <strong>target keywords</strong> you provided and following best practices for on-page SEO:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}.</p>
        <p>The first draft is typically ready in less than a minute. For a long article (~2000 words), it may take a bit longer as the AI is writing a lot of content and possibly querying search for multiple facts. You’ll see a loading status until it's ready.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-detail">
        <h2>Step 3: Review and Refine</h2>
        <p>Your full article draft will appear on the screen, neatly formatted with an introduction, body sections, and a conclusion. Any <strong>citations</strong> (external sources) will be listed as references at the end. Now it’s your turn: you can read through and make edits directly in the editor. Maybe you want to add a personal anecdote, adjust the tone, or insert an extra fact – it’s all easy to do.</p>
        <p>We recommend verifying any critical facts. The AI does pull real information to minimize inaccuracies, but double-checking never hurts for important content. On the plus side, because the AI did the heavy lifting, you’re editing a rich draft, not a blank page – a huge time saver.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-detail">
        <h2>Step 4: Insert Images & Links</h2>
        <p>If you need an image for the article, switch to the **Image Generator** tool in your dashboard. Enter a description (or let the AI suggest one based on your article) to create a unique image that complements your text. You can download and include it in your blog post.</p>
        <p>SEOscribe will have already taken care of **internal linking** if applicable (linking to your other articles). You can add more links or adjust anchor text during your review. Internal links help search engines navigate your site and can boost your SEO by establishing a clear site structure:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}, so this step is valuable for your overall strategy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-detail">
        <h2>Step 5: Publish & Track Results</h2>
        <p>Now your content is ready to publish! Copy it into your CMS (WordPress, etc.) or download it. Because SEOscribe’s output is optimized and enriched, you can publish with confidence that it stands a good chance to rank and engage readers. Many users report significantly faster content turnaround and improved search rankings after switching to AI-assisted writing.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <!-- Each FAQ question from earlier, possibly expanded with more detail -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is an AI article writer and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>An AI article writer is software that uses artificial intelligence to generate written content. It works by leveraging <strong>Large Language Models</strong> – AI trained on vast amounts of text (books, websites, articles) – to predict and compose text based on your prompts:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}. Think of it as predicting the next words in a sentence, but on a huge scale with understanding of context.</p>
        <p>When you provide a prompt, the AI analyzes it, possibly researches it (as SEOscribe does via search), and then begins generating text. It considers context, tone, and even SEO factors as it writes:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. The result is a draft that reads naturally, almost as if a human wrote it. Modern AI writers can produce content that’s surprisingly coherent and on-topic, though editing by a human is still recommended for the best quality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will using AI hurt my SEO or violate Google’s rules?</h3>
        <p>No, using AI to assist with writing does not inherently hurt SEO. Google cares about the quality and usefulness of content. In fact, Google has explicitly stated that **AI-generated content is allowed** so long as it isn’t spammy:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}. What you should avoid is using AI to mass-produce low-quality pages just to rank – that falls under spam. But using AI to create well-researched, well-written articles that genuinely help readers is completely fine.</p>
        <p>SEOscribe actually <em>improves</em> your SEO by ensuring best practices in your content. It helps include relevant keywords (without over-stuffing), uses proper heading structures, and links to authoritative sources when appropriate. All these factors align with what search engines want: helpful, reliable content:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does SEOscribe ensure the content is SEO-friendly?</h3>
        <p>Our platform has SEO “baked in.” First, we allow you to input target keywords or choose a suggested focus keyword. The AI then makes sure to weave those into the article naturally (in titles, headings, and body text). It also generates content with a clear structure – including an H1 title, H2 section headings, and so on – which is important for SEO:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}.</p>
        <p>Additionally, SEOscribe can generate a meta description for your article, which you can use on your webpage for better click-through rates from Google. Internal linking is another SEO boost – if you have other articles on related topics, SEOscribe will suggest linking to them, which helps search engines understand the relationship between your posts and can pass authority between pages:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}.</p>
        <p>Finally, because we integrate real-time research, the content is more likely to be factual and up-to-date, which improves its E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) – factors that indirectly benefit SEO.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need to edit the AI’s output? Is it plagiarism-free?</h3>
        <p>SEOscribe’s content is generated from scratch for each prompt, so it is <strong>plagiarism-free</strong> (we do not copy any existing article verbatim). We even provide citations for key facts, which you wouldn’t get if it was copying something. The content passes standard plagiarism checkers in our testing.</p>
        <p>However, we do recommend you edit the output as needed. While the AI is very good, it’s not perfect – there might be sections you want to refine or a particular tone you want to enforce. Think of the AI’s draft as a talented junior writer’s work: it covers the main points and saves you a ton of time, but a quick review and tweak by you will ensure the piece is exactly to your liking and high-quality. This human touch can add nuance or examples the AI wouldn’t know to include.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What topics can SEOscribe write about? Are there any limits?</h3>
        <p>SEOscribe can handle a wide array of topics – from technology, health, finance, marketing, lifestyle, and more. Our underlying AI model has been trained on diverse information, so it has knowledge in many domains. That said, extremely niche or specialized topics might need more detailed prompts or might result in a shorter draft if info is scarce.</p>
        <p>We also enforce usage policies: the AI won’t produce hateful or illicit content, for example. And on the free plan, there’s a limit of one article per day as mentioned. If you try to write on a topic that requires up-to-the-minute news (e.g., “today’s stock prices”), the AI will attempt to fetch info via our search integration, but very real-time or sensitive data might not be perfect – always verify critical details in those cases.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the free plan vs Pro plan work?</h3>
        <p>On the Free plan, you can generate 1 article per day (and up to a certain number of images per month). This is a generous free tier to let you experience the power of SEOscribe and even maintain a basic content schedule for a blog. The Pro plan is a paid subscription (monthly or annual) which gives you <strong>unlimited</strong> article generations – no daily cap – plus faster output (priority in the queue), the ability to generate even longer articles (up to 5000+ words if needed, in sections), and priority support from our team.</p>
        <p>Many users start free and upgrade once they see how much time it saves. If you plan to publish frequently or run multiple sites, Pro is absolutely worth it. We’ve priced it competitively (see <a href="pricing.html">Pricing</a>) relative to other AI writing tools, especially given the inclusion of SEO features that others charge extra for.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use the content anywhere? Who owns the content?</h3>
        <p>Yes, once you generate an article with SEOscribe, it’s yours. You have full rights to use, edit, and publish the content as you see fit (be it on your blog, in marketing materials, etc.). We do not retain any ownership of the outputs. We also don't publish them elsewhere – your content is unique to you.</p>
        <p>We just ask that you use the content responsibly (no spamming or misuse) per our terms of service. But otherwise, consider SEOscribe your content co-pilot – you remain the owner and editor-in-chief of all final outputs.</p>
